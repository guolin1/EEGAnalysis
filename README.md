MVPA:
  1. linear SVM Classification [one-vs-one using leave out one cross validation]
  2. Representational Dissimilarity Analysis using Cross-validated Euclidian Distances

Time Frequency Analyses:
  1. Wavelet transform
  2. Gliding fast fourier transform (Tapered using hanning window)

Statistics
  1. non-parametric (sign permutation test), cluster-based approach to correct for multiple comparisons across time (time-resolved 1D)
  2. non-parametric (sign permutation test), cluster-based approach to correct for multiple comparisons across time-time (temporal generalization 2D)
